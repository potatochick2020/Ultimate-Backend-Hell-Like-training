## This Frontend is not build by me

Here is the source repo: [AMAZONA](https://github.com/basir/mern-amazona )

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker build -t react-docker:1.0.0 .`

This will build a docker image named react-docker with 1.0.0 as tag

### `docker run --rm -it --name web -p 3000:3000 react-docker:1.0.0`

This will build the front end image
